üìö What is a RAG Model?
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a hybrid AI model architecture that combines information retrieval with generative language models to produce more accurate and up-to-date answers.

üß† How It Works (in Simple Steps):
User Question ‚Üí The user asks a question (e.g., "What is quantum computing?").

Retriever ‚Üí Instead of relying only on model memory, RAG fetches relevant documents (e.g., PDFs, web pages, DB entries) using similarity search (usually via vector databases like FAISS or Pinecone).

Generator ‚Üí A language model (like GPT or Gemini) then reads both the question and the retrieved documents to generate a grounded, informed response.

üîß Key Components:
Document Store: Stores your external knowledge (PDFs, web content, etc.)

Vector Database (e.g., FAISS): Stores embeddings of document chunks for fast similarity search.

Embedding Model: Converts text into numerical vectors.

Retriever: Fetches the most relevant chunks based on the query.

LLM (e.g., GPT, Gemini, Claude): Generates the final response using both the query and retrieved info.

‚úÖ Advantages:
Up-to-date: Pulls in recent or external info not known to the model.

More accurate: Reduces hallucinations by grounding output in real data.

Customizable: You can control what knowledge it uses (e.g., company docs, medical articles).




 #code explanation--Packages

langchain ‚Äì Framework to build applications using large language models (LLMs).

langchain-groq ‚Äì Integrates Groq's ultra-fast LLMs with LangChain.

langchain-google-genai ‚Äì Connects Google‚Äôs Gemini and other GenAI models to LangChain.

langchain-community ‚Äì Provides community-contributed tools and integrations for LangChain.

#modules


os: Interacts with the operating system (e.g., to read environment variables like API keys).

time: Used for timing operations (e.g., measuring response time).

from langchain_groq import ChatGroq
Uses Groq‚Äôs ultra-fast LLMs (e.g., LLaMA 3, Mixtral) as the chat model.

from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
Splits large text (like from PDFs) into smaller overlapping chunks for better retrieval.

from langchain.chains.combine_documents import create_stuff_documents_chain
Creates a chain that "stuffs" all retrieved documents into the LLM‚Äôs input along with the user query.


from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
Allows you to customize prompts (system + user instructions) for the LLM.

from langchain.chains import create_retrieval_chain
Connects the retriever + LLM to create a working retrieval-augmented generation chain.

from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
Uses FAISS (by Facebook) to store and retrieve similar document chunks efficiently.

from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFDirectoryLoader
Loads and reads all PDF files from a directory, converting them to text documents.

from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings
Converts document text into embeddings using Google‚Äôs Gemini models, which are then stored in FAISS for similarity search.


ChatGroq: Initializes the LLM with:

temperature=0 ‚Üí deterministic output

groq_api_key ‚Üí authenticates your request

model_name ‚Üí selects Groq-hosted LLaMA 3.3 70B Versatile




üß† 1. Prompt Template
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
"""
Answer the question based only on the following context and try to predict the answer to some questions by thinking logically.
Combine all information into a single concise paragraph that best answers the question.

{context}

Question: {input}
"""
)
üîπ Purpose:
Defines how the LLM should behave during question answering.

üîπ Key Elements:

{context} ‚Üí Placeholder for retrieved document chunks.

{input} ‚Üí Placeholder for the user‚Äôs actual question.

It instructs the model to:

Stick to the provided context.

Think logically if the answer isn‚Äôt directly stated.

Write the answer as a single concise paragraph.


text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
chunk_size=1000: Each chunk will be about 1000 characters.

chunk_overlap=200: The end of each chunk will overlap by 200 characters with the next one to preserve context across chunks.





 Summary of What You Did
Step	Description
os.environ[...]	Set the Google API key for authentication.
PyPDFLoader	Loaded your PDF resume file.
RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter	Split it into overlapping chunks for better embedding and retrieval.
GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings	Used Google‚Äôs embedding-001 model to convert text chunks into vector embeddings.
FAISS.from_documents(...)	Created a vector store from the document chunks.



if user_question:
    document_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, prompt)
    retriever = vector_store.as_retriever()
    retrieval_chain = create_retrieval_chain(retriever, document_chain)
retriever: Finds the most relevant document chunks using FAISS.

document_chain: Formats the prompt and sends it to the LLM (Groq in your case).

retrieval_chain: Connects retriever + LLM to answer your question with context.


üîç What Is a Retriever?
A retriever is an object that, given a user question, finds and returns the most relevant document chunks from your vector store.




retrieval_chain = create_retrieval_chain(retriever, document_chain)
This line creates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chain, which is a system that answers user questions by retrieving relevant document chunks and then generating a final answer using an LLM.
